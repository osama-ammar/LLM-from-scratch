# LLM from Scratch

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. The objective is to create an LLM capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts. The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracts and preprocesses training data.
2. **Model Architecture**: Defines the architecture of the LLM.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Implements the training process and evaluates the model's performance.

## Repository Structure

```plaintext
├── chatbot.py              # Main script to interact with the trained LLM
├── data-extract-v3.py      # Handles data extraction and preprocessing
└── model_architecture.py   # Defines the neural network architecture of the LLM

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Pandas
- NumPy

Install dependencies using:
